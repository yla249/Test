 			<h3>Utrecht, the Netherlands</h3>
 		<p>Before my graduation from SFU, I spent my last semester of University
 		in the city Utrecht in the Netherlands.</p>
 		
 		
 		
 		<p>Utrecht is the four largest cities in the Netherlands,located in the eastern
 		part of the country. As an university city, it is hosted by Utrecht University and
 		its population is mainly made of local and international students. Also it is 
 		ranked as one of the best cities for cycling that everyone in town must have a
 		bike to get around. 
 		</p>
 		
           <br/>

 		 	<p>Living in this historial city was an amazing experience. During daytime I cycled
 	       along canals the downtown campus, taking classes in a castle-like building. At night
 	       friends and I would hang in a group at our apartment-building or visited the
 	       bars in the town. I remembered that we used to visit a a shooter bar 
 	       called "Chupitos",where provided a variety of drinks(shots) with only two euros on 
 	       every Tuesday. Also it was a nice place for dancing as it played good music there.
 	        </p>

 		 <p>Dutch culture impressed me with a strong sense of "community" or "group". As 
 	     an International student there, I always went out with a large group with more than ten people.      
 		 When came to study, 70% of my coursework was mandatory group-work that allowed me
 		 to  collaborate with not only international students but also local dutch students. 
 		 It was easy to make friends with the Dutch students there who were candid
 		 and open-minded. I was lucky enough to have a chance to live in this less 
 		 known but friendly city.

 			</figure>	
 			<p>Prior to 2011, I grew up and lived in Guangzhou city in China (also known as "Canton").
 		 	</p>
 		 	<p>Guangzhou is the capital and largest city in Guangdong Province, located in
 		 	the north-west of Hong Kong. People in Guangzhou are mostly bilinguals who 
 		 	can speak Cantonese and Mandarin. Durning weekend, they enjoy having dim-sum         as brunch with the families.</p>

 		 	</figure>
 		 	<p>If you ever have a chance to visit my home-city Guangzhou, I will recommend 
 		 	you to visit the Canton Tower,the landmark of the city.</p>
 		 
 		<div id="note"> 
 	    <mark>Note:In this homework I apply two new tags of HTML5, "audio"tag and
 	    "mark" tag.</mark>
 	  
 	    <p><mark> "Audio" tag </mark> is the parent tag of the "source"tag. The "source" tag is used
 	    to link different audio files. For example:</p>
 		 <audio controls loop>
 		 <source src="material/shlohmo_places.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
 		 </audio>
 		 <p>
 		 It can be used by most of the popular browsers including Chrome, IE, Opera,Safari
 		 and Firefox. </p> 
 		 
 		<p>In this document, please view the "mark" tag's effect on safari and firefox. 
 		<mark>"Mark"tag </mark> is used to highlight parts of your tag.It is supported by most 
 		of the browsers including IE, Opera, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
